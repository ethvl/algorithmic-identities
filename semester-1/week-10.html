                    <h3>From Observation to Conceptual Development</h3>
                    <p>This week's task-based making focused on translating observation into action. After refining my
                        research through the RPO, I set out to create a structured plan that would move my project
                        forward in a deliberate and methodical way. The ArtScience Museum field trip played a
                        significant role in shaping this week’s direction. Experiencing the spatial, interactive, and
                        sensory qualities of the exhibitions made me see more clearly how digital exhibition design can
                        be used to make invisible systems tangible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Google's Quick, Draw!</strong> stood out to me. Watching my sketches being instantly
                        interpreted by an AI
                        made the invisible computational process visible in a playful yet experimental way. I asked
                        myself, <em>if such drawings can show how machines interpret humans, could I reverse that
                            process to expose how human experience is being interpreted by machines?</em></p>
                    <p>This line of questioning guided the creation for the task-based making experiment. Instead of
                        showing how AI "reads" us, I want to invert the relationship and invite participants to share
                        their own
                        encounters with algorithmic systems. Stories shared becomes part of a collective, living
                        archive. The aim is to transform private digital moments into a shared emotional space, where
                        people can recognise patterns, empathise with one another, and critically reflect on how
                        algorithms quietly shape everyday life.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Task Plan</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>To support this, I designed a clear plan outlining:</p>
                    <p><strong>⑴ Aim & Purpose</strong><br>• Make algorithmic experiences visible and shareable<br> •
                        Turn private digital encounters into a collective emotional archive, evoke empathy and dialogue
                        by allowing viewers to recognised shared vulnerabilities and reflect on how algorithmic systems
                        shape everyday life<br>•  Display responses publicly on screen<br>•  Foundation for exploring
                        how such a participatory archive could evolve into an exhibition design
                        that is spatial, immersive, and socially reflective
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>⑵ Method</strong><br>• Develop a web-based interface where participants can anonymously
                        submit short written entries, images, or screenshots reflecting their encounters with
                        algorithmic systems (e.g., targeted ads, recommendation loops,
                        misclassifications)<br>• Aggregate all submissions into a generative visual display that
                        continuously updates, forming a living archive of algorithmic experiences<br>• Observe how
                        participants interact with and emotionally respond to the growing archive<br>• Sketch and
                        illustrate how this system could expand into a physical exhibition space, envisioning screens,
                        projections, or printed “walls of data” to translate the digital archive into a collective
                        spatial experience</p>
                    <p><strong>⑶ Plan</strong><br>• Define data structure (text, image, reflection), and design
                        low-fidelity wireframes for the upload and viewing interface<br> • Build working prototype for
                        submissions and visual display using HTML, CSS, and JS<br> • Soft launch with a few participants
                        to collect initial responses (observe tone, emotion, and engagement)<br>• Map out how this
                        participatory archive could be adapted into an exhibition design (spatial sketches and interface
                        visuals)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This experiment aims to connect data-driven visualisation with participatory storytelling,
                        transforming individual encounters with algorithms into a shared public experience. By doing so,
                        it frames the exhibition not just as a site of observation but as a space for emotional
                        reflection and conversation.</p>

                    <p>Andreas responded positively to my task plan, noting that the structure I created is clear,
                        actionable, and sustainable across iterations. He acknowledges the ambition of the experiment
                        but encouraged me to <strong>think modularly</strong> rather than trying to build one large,
                        all-in-one system from the start. His advice reframed the project into five manageable modules:

                    <p>How I visualise participants sharing their experience is after submitting their response on the
                        form, the content will show up on a text box container for readability. Initially, I did not add
                        the application tag, but after much consideration, I decided to add in the application tag to
                        show which application this experience happened on for better categorisation. Once the response
                        is submitted, it will fade in and appear on the homepage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>For future iterations, I plan to add in a function where participants can attach and upload an
                        image to visually show their experience through e.g. screenshots. To increase engagement, I can
                        consider making these boxes reactive, where participants can press and hold to react with an
                        emoji, or comment. These small gestures would encourage participants to respond to one another’s
                        stories, transforming the archive from a static collection of entries into a dynamic, socially
                        responsive space where people can collectively process and contextualise their encounters with
                        algorithmic systems.

                        to
                        share their experiences, there will be a <strong>QR</strong> code that participants can scan,

                        can contribute seamlessly while maintaining a clear sense of where their input goes and how it
                        becomes part of the shared experience.

                    <p>In one of CiD's workshops, we learnt about Node.js. Since my experiment collects responses from
                        participants and immediately displays them on the live wall, I needed a backend that is fast,
                        lightweight, and easy to prototype. It allows the entire process to communicate seamlessly in
                        real time.</p>
                    <p>To transform the experiment from a static visual prototype into a participatory system, I needed
                        a way to collect, store, and update participant submissions in real life. This led me to design
                        a simple back-end architecture made of two core components:</p>
                    <p><strong>⑴ server.js (brain)</strong><br>As the central controller of the entire experiment, this
                        handles the logic of receiving new participant submissions, reading the entire existing archive,
                        and sending data back to the front-end. It defines simple API endpoints such as
                        <strong>readALL()</strong> and <strong>writeAll(),</strong> which keep the entire system modular
                        and easy to debug.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>⑵ responses.json (memory)</strong><br>Inspired by my research into <strong>Google's
                            Quick, Draw!</strong> dataset, <strong>JSON</strong> offers the format I need for this
                        experiment. Functioning as the project's temporary database, every submission is stored here as
                        a simple <strong>JSON</strong> array. Each entry is saved with an ID, content, and timestamp. It
                        allows the archive to "remember" past inputs even after the server restarts.</p>

                    <p>A clear and intentional project structure is essential because this experiment operates across
                        multiple layers. Without a modular architecture, the system would be difficult for me to
                        maintain, debug, or scale. By separating the project into distinct folders and responsibilities,
                        I can iterate them independently why ensuring all components still work seamlessly.</p>

                        responses. Separting the visuals from the submission logic allows me to prototype the look,
                        behaviour, and experience of the archive without touching the data processing layer.</p>

                        input tool manages the submission form, gathers text, and communicates the data to the server.
                        Isolating the form allows me to redesign the interaction flow without affecting the archive

                    <h3><strong>Challenges Faced</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>Reaching this stage was not easy. I went through six rounds of iteraction, each revealed new
                        issues in readability, structure, interaction, and conceptual clarity.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑴ Interface Issues (Iteration 1-2)</strong><br>The first versions displayed submissions
                        in a single expanding text box that grew to fill the entire screen. It was not the UI I wanted,
                        it was overwhelming and visually unreadable especially when new submissions are added. It felt
                        too flat and mechanical.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑵ Readability Challenges (Iteration 3-4)</strong><br>When more submissions were added, it
                        overlapped visually and became difficult to read. There were opacity issues with the text
                        display box that made it look washed out.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑶ Issues with Title Placement (Iteration 5)</strong><br>After the first few rounds of
                        iteration, I realised that people might not understand what the text well is about if they just
                        see it on the screen. Having a title would provide better context so that participants could
                        immediately understand: <em>What is this wall? Why are these messages here? What am I supposed
                            to do?</em> I tried several placements such as putting it in a corner but it looked too much
                        like a web interface. Sticky header was visually distracting, and a floating label interfers
                        with the text display boxes.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑷ Poor Text "Character" (Iteration 6)</strong><br>Another majoy challenge was the
                        behaviour of these text display boxes. Initially they popped in abruptly, sat still, behaved
                        very rigidly. I had to add in subtle transitions to let it fade in while appearing.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>After presenting this task experiment process and demo to Andreas, his feedback helped reframe
                        the experiment not just as a single functioning prototype, but as a system made of
                        interdependent layers. He emphasied the importance of distinguishing between the <strong>visual,
                            technical, and system layers.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>⑴ Visual Layer</strong><br>Concerns what audiences see such as the aesthetic quality,
                        text behaviour, motion, and emotional tone.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑵ Technical Layer</strong><br>Captures how the system runs, the form logic, form
                        handling, real-time updates.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑶ System Layer</strong><br>Describes how everything interacts, how user input moves from
                        the interface → to the backend → back to the visual display.</p>
                    <p>The current submission form also feels too plain. Mainly the front-end visuals are too flat and
                        boring. I need to strengthen and work on the <strong>exhibition thinking</strong>, to articulate
                        why this work is framed as an exhibition and what it achieves conceptually. It would be great if
                        I could sketch out how participants will interact with the wall and what the space communicates
                        emotionally and socially.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p><strong>The Room of Change</strong> is a 30-metre long “data tapestry” created for the 2019
                        edition of XXII Triennale di Milano, exhibition titled Broken Nature: Design Takes on Human
                        Survival. The installation spans the walls of a gallery room. From left to right, it visualises
                        change over time: from the past, through the present, and into a speculative future. It
                        aggregates and layers multiple global datasets (e.g. world population, energy consumption,
                        temperature, disease rates) alongside more local or human-scale stories (e.g. the decline of a
                        specific lake, shifts in economy, demographic shifts in a country), giving both macro and micro
                        views of change.</p>
                    <p>The piece illustrates the principle of <strong>“data humanism”</strong>: treating data not just
                        as numbers but as stories, as lives, as collective memory. Rather than hiding complexity under
                        charts, the tapestry embraces density and invites reflection. By covering the wall with layered
                        information, it reveals how global systems and local lives are entangled.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>Like Lupi’s tapestry, I’m interested in <strong>how data turns experience into
                            representation,</strong> how
                        personal behaviours, preferences, histories can be <strong>abstracted into data,</strong> and
                        how that
                        representation can be visualised in a way that <em>retains meaning and emotional weight.</em>
                        I’m also
                        drawn to the <strong>scale-shift:</strong> from individual data to global patterns, from the
                        granular to the
                        systemic.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Room of Change</strong> demonstrates how a wall-wide tapestry can hold centuries of
                        change; similarly,
                        my work experiments aim to <strong>encode</strong> identity traits and actions into visual,
                        material form, <strong>making visible what is usually hidden.</strong> The immersive, sensory
                        quality of the installation inspires me to think beyond charts and graphs, to treat data as
                        living environments, where viewers/participants don’t just observe, but inhabit, explore,
                        reflect.</p>

                    <p>Lupi's hand-drawn sketch of <strong>The Room of Change</strong> reveals more than just the layout
                        of an installation. It exposes her entire way of thinking about how data can be transformed into
                        an experiential, architectural narrative. The sketch breaks the exhibition down into time,
                        themes, and layers, showing how the room wraps around the viewer as a continuous, evolving data
                        story. Instead of treating data as static information, she designs it spatially: each coloured
                        band becomes a timeline, each vertical slice a moment in history, and the entire room a living
                        map of human and environmental change.</p>

                        visual plan. The quick annotations show how she frames data through relationships, categories,
                        rather than numbers. This aligns strongly with my goal to translate invisible algorithmic
                        processes into experiences that can be seen, felt, and navigated. Her sketch shows that an
