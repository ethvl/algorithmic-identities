                    <h3><strong>Scope → Structure → Synthesise</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>⑴ Scope</strong><br> After the mindmapping session, I honed in on what aspects of
                        algorithmic identities were most compelling. I narrowed down the broad field by scoping key
                        ideas and reflecting on Andreas' comments, which helped anchor my research around the three core
                        pillars: datafication, feedback loops, and manipulation.<br><br>
                        <strong>⑵ Structure</strong><br> With this focus, I actively gathered and categorised references
                        under each pillar. Each section was carefully structured to define and introduce key terms,
                        outline theoretical frameworks, and clarify the relevance of the literature to my chosen
                        angle.<br><br>
                        <strong>⑶ Synthesise</strong><br> The most crucial work is to connect the dots. Instead of
                        treating the three pillars as separate silos, I showed how they rely on and inform each other. I
                        created a coherent flow that reflects the complexity of algorithmic identities.

                        <strong>⑴ Datafication and Manipulation</strong><br> One of the main points was to clearly show
                        evidence of BOTH datafication and manipulation. These two pillars should form a continuous
                        narrative, rather than stand alone and transition logicially into each other. This means mapping
                        out how personal data is turned into content (e.g Data → TikTok → Identity Creation) and
                        examining WHERE manipulation occurs within that process.<br><br>
                        <strong>⑵ Questioning</strong><br> Andreas raised an important question: If I want to explore
                        the creative dimension, how can I do that without losing sight of the systemic forces at
                        play?<br><br>
                    <p>One idea we disucussed was using TikTok as a case study to trace how the platform's algorithm
                        influences identity construction, essentially showing both how we can manipulate the system, and
                        how it manipulates us in return. He encourages me to analyses different apps and their
                        algorithms, not just TikTok, to broaden the scope.<br><br>The focus here is to interrogate what
                        the impact is, what the purpose behind these systems might
                        be, and how they shape user behaviour and perception. Ethics also came up as a crucial layer to
                        explore. Referencing thinkers like <strong>Aza Raskin</strong> could help ground this aspect. It
                        was suggested
                        that I dig deeper into the ethical implications, not just surface-level critique.<br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Andreas advised that I carefully plan what to track, why it matters, and what materials or data
                        I’ll need. There should be a clear rationale for the methods I choose, and this experiment
                        should link back directly to the broader research question.</p>

                    <p><strong>⑴ Clarity of Research Objective</strong><br>• Research objective currently reads vaguely,
                        and requires further articulation.<br>• Important to define how the research will be conducted
                        and who it is addressing.<br>• Research question should directly encompass and connect with the
                        objectives to answer the central question.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑵ Consistency in Terminology</strong><br>• Maintain terminology consistency throughout
                        the paper.<br>• Term "data-driven visualisation" should be retained, avoid introducing
                        overlapping or confusing terms such as "creative experiments."<br>• Glossary or table may be
                        helpful to define and clarify recurring terms.</p>
                    <p><strong>⑶ Refine and Define Structure & Purpose</strong><br>• Structure should have a clear
                        narrative that moves from exploration to practical application.<br>• What is the purpose and aim
                        or exhibition design? Immerse or design? Extracting meaning from data, or designing a
                        dashboard-like experience that enables data interaction? </p>
                    <p><strong>⑷ Theoretical Expansion & Context</strong><br>• Exhibition design section needs to expand
                        theoretically, situating it within existing discourse.<br>• Fostering engagment and critical
                        conversations could extend beyond the exhibition through artist talks, symposiums, or discussion
                        sessions.<br>• Write in third-person perspective and when referencing scholars and professors,
                        be explicit about their field or discipline.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The Social Dilemma is a Netflix documentary-drama that explores how major tech platforms
                        manipulate user behaviour through algorithms designed to maximise engagement. Featuring
                        interviews with former tech insiders, it reveals the psychological, social, and political
                        consequences of surveillance capitalism. The film highlights how these systems contribute to
                        issues like addiction, polarisation, and the erosion of individual autonomy.
                    </p>
                    <p>The film encapsulated many of the core issues I want to interrogate in my research on algorithmic
                        identity and platform design. It resonated deeply because I already witnessed firsthand during
                        my internship at TikTok. What struck me most was their visualisation of the “doppelgänger”, a
                        predictive avatar built from our data. It was almost exactly what I had envisioned in my head
                        and hoped to show to people through my own work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The discussion of A/B testing also hit close. This is precisely how TikTok operates: constant
                        experiments trialling slight changes in features or layouts to see which version drives the
                        desired outcome. The three goals mentioned in the film: engagement, growth, and revenue; are not
                        abstract principles but actual verticals within TikTok, with different teams dedicated to
                        optimising each, powered by these tests. And then there is the ethical irony: helping to design
                        such systems by day, only to fall prey to them by night. I saw the immense effort poured into
                        optimising attention and growth, yet still found myself caught in the same usage loops after
                        work.</p>
                    <p>The film sharpened key parts of my argument and validated my own observations, bridging theory
                        with lived experience. It has given me clearer direction for how I might translate these
                        insights into impactful outcomes in my research.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>This visual experiment was inspired by Writer and artist James Bridle's "The nightmare videos of
                        childrens' YouTube — and what's wrong with the internet today" TED Talk. He mapped out how
                        YouTube's autoplay feature continously feeds the next video.</p>
                    <p>I adapted this method to my own research. By arranging the screenshots in order, I can visualise
                        the identity assumptions the algorithm makes from the outset (cold start), and how quickly
                        reinforcement patterns begin to appear. This flow provides a clear, image-based record of

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>From a critical standpoint, we can see how the social media algorithms from these three
                        applications are not neutral recommendation engines. They are mechanisms designed to maximise
                        engagement and, ultimately, monetisation.</p>
                    <p>The results showed that Instagram's algorithm was the most invasive, pushing targeted content
                        most aggressively and collapsing identity signals into narrow categories almost immediately.
                        TikTok followed closely, also quick to amplify specific interests but still leaving space for
                        broader content to surface. YouTube proved the least invasive, shifting recommendations more
                        slowly and maintaining a more diverse mix of suggestions. Together, these differences reveal how
                        each platform designs its algorithmic intensive, with Instagram leading in immediacy, TikTok in
                        speed of amplification, and YouTube in persistence over time.</p>
                    <p>What feels like "choice" is in fact highly orchestrated. A handful of clicks or swipes can
                        rapidly collapse a complex self into a narrow marketable persona. This demonstrates how quickly
                        datafication feeds into feedback loops and manipulation, echoing The Social Dilemma’s warning
                        that our online interactions are commodified experiments in attention capture. Ultimately, the
                        experiment makes visible the hidden mechanics of algorithmic identity-shaping, raising questions
                        about agency, consent, and how much control we truly have over what we see and who we become
                        online.</p>
