                    <p>
                        Taking Andreas' feedback seriously from last week, I did a deliberate uncomfortable reflection
                        on how my attention is shaped, fragmented, and quietly harvested in environments of extreme
                        media saturation. I tried to focus on what kind of small interactions I make on social media
                        apps and I settled down on the action of "clicking". The small, repetitive clicks felt
                        instinctive, almost meaningless.</p>
                    <p>A lot of content now adays create memes and they thrive in rapid circulation. They are instantly
                        recognisable, emotionally efficient, and endlessly replaceable. Memes demand very little from us
                        cognitively, yet they are highly effective at capturing attention and prompting interaction.</p>

                    <p>Shifting the focus away from large, dramatic gestures, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong>
                        operates through a single <strong>micro-interaction</strong> action: clicking. The intention is
                        to make the user pause and ask a deceptively simple question: <em>why am I still clicking?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is an interactive webpage where users are to repeatedly select content they recognise or feel
                        drawn to. At first, the experience feels playful, but beneath the surface, the system is
                        constantly recording behaviour: <em>what is clicked, how often, and in what patterns</em>. As
                        they are feeding the system with their interactions, these data are being translated into an
                        identity portrait of themselves. It is a constructed version of the user that emerge not from
                        who they claim to be, but from all the content they clicked on and engaged with.</p>
                    <p>By centring the experience around memes, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong> mirrors the way users
                        consume large volumes of digital content quickly, often without reflection or lasting value. The
                        work questions <em>what happens</em> when interaction becomes habitual rather than meaningful.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong> functions as narrative about quiet participation.
                        It reveals how seemingly trival actions like clicking are woven into larger systems that define
                        who we are through data. By making this process visible, it invites users to reflection on how
                        easily identity can be formed through their patterns of behaviour, and how often we surrender
                        agency without even noticing.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>I curated a small "database" of familiar meme images and short viral meme clips by actively
                        scouring online spaces where brainrot content spreads fastest. The memes are used as a raw
                        material of digital attention, low-effort to consume, and designed to trigger quick clicks. To
                        echo the logic of apps and gaming interfaces, I built a HUD-style onboarding screen where users
                        are asked to input their particulars, framing the experience as a system that "needs" data
                        before it begins.</p>
                    <p>Once it starts, every click triggers a new state. The interface multiples, splits, and floods the
                        screen with more randomised meme content. The interaction escalates quickly, simulating how
                        platforms reward engagement with constant novelty and volume. As the user keeps clicking, the
                        system quietly collects what they choose and then recomposes these into an identity portrait.
                        The final output turns mindless consumption into visible inference: an "algorithmic identity" of
                        the user built from nothing but the content they couldn't stop interacting with.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The interaction is intentionally static and irreversible: nothing changes unless the user acts,
                        and once recorded, actions cannot be undone. Typing becomes a proxy for behavioural data, where
                        longer inputs generate stronger system responses. Randomised placement of effects highlights the
                        opacity of how data is processed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over time, the identity becomes increasingly marked and system-defined. It becomes more
                        recognisable to the human eye. This tensions mirrors how data-driven systems turn our everyday
                        interactions into lasting computational traces.</p>

                        the image mask, then stamping random ASCII characters onto those regions. While it produced a
                        visually satisfying effect, the logiv became too surface-level. The system wasn't clearly
                        translating the idea of datafication. The stamping was randomised and it was heavily dependent
                        on threshold settings so the outcome was hard to "sell" beyond the visual.</p>
                    <p>I also struggled with control and clarity. Small parameter changes (threshold, strength,
                        character size, spacing) could dramatically alter the image which made the portrait too dark,
                        too sparse, or inconsistent. The interaction also overlapped behaviour.
                        <strong>intensify()</strong> was triggered constantly, which made the system feel like it was
                        always reacting but not necessarily with intention.
                    </p>
                    <p>These challenges pushed me to redesign toward a more deliberate trigger so that accumulation
                        reads as system inscription rather than visual chaos.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Dean Nur's Feedback</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The feedback received from the Dean affirmed that <strong>Prototype 6: World of Brainrot</strong>
                        is a strong and relevant starting point, particularly in its use of viral content to reflect the
                        realism of contemporary digital behaviour. The interactive flow successfully mirrors how people
                        actually engage with media, making the experience feel familiar rather than staged. However, the
                        work needs to move beyond recognition and novelty towards deeper reflection and consequence.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➀ Grounded Meaningful Data</strong></h3>
                    <p>Rather than abstract clicks, the experience could begin with more relatable entry points such as
                        food, culture, politics etc. using curated datasets (e.g. top trending foods or dominant
                        political narratives) to help audience see themselves more clearly in the system. Using real or
                        semi-real data would allow users to react emotionally and critically to their own patterns,
                        rather than treating the interaction as playful noise.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➁ Exhibition Context and Scale</strong></h3>
                    <p>The feedback also challenged me to think more deliberately about exhibition context and scale.
                        The work should not feel niche or self-contained, but capable of aggregating individual
                        interactions into a larger portrait of collective behaviour. This opens up questions of how
                        personal data becomes cultural data, and how shared habits shape algorithmic norms.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➂ Emotion: Guilt</strong></h3>
                    <p>Emotionally, the dean pointed towards <em>guilt</em> as a powerful but underexplored affect.
                        Doomscrolling is not just passive consumption. It often carries a quiet sense of discomfort,
                        addiction, and self-awareness. Rather than explicitly naming addiction, the work could surface
                        guilt through subtle prompts, emotional questions, and reflective moments such as revealing
                        hours spent, repetitive choices, or emotional dependencies. Researching how artists provoke
                        emotional response through sound, staging, or pacing could help deepen this affective layer.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <p>Overall, the feedback pushes the project to evolve from a simulation of brainrot into a
                        reflective system: one that makes users confront their consumption habits, question their
                        agency, and consider whether awareness might lead to behavioural change.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Group Feedback</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The feedback made me reflect on how the experience could feel more open and intuitive, particularly at the start. There was a clear preference for allowing users to interact freely rather than guiding them through structured steps or form-filling, which helped me realise that my entry point may be too restrictive. Andreas personally did not like the idea of having to fill in the form, and that the bootLog starting screen was redundant. I was prompted to form a coherent narrative. While the project was described as ambitious, I was encouraged to move forward with the current plan, test it with real users, and improve it through feedback rather than over-refining it in theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>What stood out most was the emphasis on the experiential quality of work, bringing audiences along a journey through interaction, especially the moment where the system reacts in engaging ways to familiar content like memes. I was also reminded that the outcomes do not need to be limited to an exhibition alone, but could extend into publications or a website, and that exploring physical forms such as 3D renders or printed models may help make the work more tangible.</p>
