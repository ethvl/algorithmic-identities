                        Taking Andreas' feedback seriously from last week, I did a deliberate uncomfortable reflection on how my attention is shaped, fragmented, and quietly harvested in environments of extreme media saturation. I tried to focus on what kind of small interactions I make on social media apps and I settled down on the action of "clicking". The small, repetitive clicks felt instinctive, almost meaningless.</p>
                    <p>A lot of content now adays create memes and they thrive in rapid circulation. They are instantly recognisable, emotionally efficient, and endlessly replaceable. Memes demand very little from us cognitively, yet they are highly effective at capturing attention and prompting interaction.</p>

                    <p>Shifting the focus away from large, dramatic gestures, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong> operates through a single <strong>micro-interaction</strong> action: clicking. The intention is to make the user pause and ask a deceptively simple question: <em>why am I still clicking?</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is an interactive webpage where users are to repeatedly select content they recognise or feel drawn to. At first, the experience feels playful, but beneath the surface, the system is constantly recording behaviour: <em>what is clicked, how often, and in what patterns</em>. As they are feeding the system with their interactions, these data are being translated into an identity portrait of themselves. It is a constructed version of the user that emerge not from who they claim to be, but from all the content they clicked on and engaged with.</p>
                    <p>By centring the experience around memes, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong> mirrors the way users consume large volumes of digital content quickly, often without reflection or lasting value. The work questions <em>what happens</em> when interaction becomes habitual rather than meaningful.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, <strong>World of Brainrot</strong> functions as narrative about quiet participation. It reveals how seemingly trival actions like clicking are woven into larger systems that define who we are through data. By making this process visible, it invites users to reflection on how easily identity can be formed through their patterns of behaviour, and how often we surrender agency without even noticing.</p>

                    <p>I began with a fixed human silhouette image, and using image trace, it is composed by ASCII
                        characters. This sets a baseline trace of the subject that never changes. Instead of altering
                        the image itself, I wanted the system to record all user interactions as permanent overlays that
                        accumulate over time.</p>
                    <p>I set the rule where each committed word becomes a data event that is incrementally thickening,
                        enlarging, or distorting clusters of characters within the silhouette. The system only records
                        data when it is submitted using the space or enter button. Rotation is triggered by pressing a
                        single key "E".</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The interaction is intentionally static and irreversible: nothing changes unless the user acts,
                        and once recorded, actions cannot be undone. Typing becomes a proxy for behavioural data, where
                        longer inputs generate stronger system responses. Randomised placement of effects highlights the
                        opacity of how data is processed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over time, the identity becomes increasingly marked and system-defined. It becomes more
                        recognisable to the human eye. This tensions mirrors how data-driven systems turn our everyday
                        interactions into lasting computational traces.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>In the earlier version of this experiment, my main challenge was the system's behaviour which
                        felt too arbitrary and aesthetic-led. The portrat was generated by detecting "white areas" in
                        the image mask, then stamping random ASCII characters onto those regions. While it produced a
                        visually satisfying effect, the logiv became too surface-level. The system wasn't clearly
                        translating the idea of datafication. The stamping was randomised and it was heavily dependent
                        on threshold settings so the outcome was hard to "sell" beyond the visual.</p>
                    <p>I also struggled with control and clarity. Small parameter changes (threshold, strength,
                        character size, spacing) could dramatically alter the image which made the portrait too dark,
                        too sparse, or inconsistent. The interaction also overlapped behaviour.
                        <strong>intensify()</strong> was triggered constantly, which made the system feel like it was
                        always reacting but not necessarily with intention.
                    </p>
                    <p>These challenges pushed me to redesign toward a more deliberate trigger so that accumulation
                        reads as system inscription rather than visual chaos.</p>

                        <strong>commentary</strong> on how we <strong>perceive media content</strong> today,
                        specifically the overwhelming, <strong>continuous influx of information</strong>. He noted how
                        content is consumed <strong>rapidly</strong> and discarded within seconds,
                        and suggested that this could be developed further as a <strong>distorted or fragmented
                            worldview</strong> shaped
                        by fast-paced media consumption. This raised the question of whether my exploration could more
                        explicitly address how social media conditions perception and attention.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➁ Micro-Experiences</strong></h3>
                    <p>A key concern was how these ideas could be communicated through
                        <strong>micro-experiences</strong>. Andreas
                        questioned how <strong>small, momentary interactions</strong> might be used to reflect the
                        speed, repetition, and
                        passivity of scrolling culture, and whether this logic could be <strong>subverted</strong> to
                        deliver more
                        <strong>meaningful or reflective</strong> content instead. The challenge is not only to
                        replicate fast content
                        delivery, but to interrupt it in a way that prompts awareness.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➂ Aesthetic → Conceptual Grounding</strong></h3>
                    <p>I was also questioned on my use of <strong>ASCII</strong> characters, noting that they currently
                        function primarily as an
                        aesthetic choice rather than a conceptually grounded one. To move beyond surface-level visuals,
                        the work needs a <strong>clearer narrative or motivation</strong>, whether through interaction,
                        storytelling, or
                        moving image, so that users understand why they are engaging with the work. Rather than
                        encouraging mindless action, the experience should <strong>provoke self-reflection</strong>,
                        such as questioning
                        habitual behaviours like doom-scrolling.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➃ Exhibition & Structural Coherence</strong></h3>
                    <p>Given that the project’s outcome is an exhibition contribution, Andreas emphasised the need to
                        think <strong>structurally</strong>: <em>how many works are involved, how they connect, and how
                            they collectively
                            communicate a coherent idea</em>. Instead of a single, monolithic piece, he suggested
                        considering
                        smaller, focused experiments: possibly multiple short interactions where <strong>one clear
                            action
                            produces a visible system response</strong>. These micro-experiments could together
                        visualise how systems
                        shape perception and behaviour, making the underlying structure of media consumption more
                        legible.

                    <p>Over the holidays, I received detailed feedback from my lecturers on both my dissertation and
                        graduation project. This week's consultation provided an opportunity to revisit these comments
                        together and unpack them more clearly. Through discussion, we clarified key issues around my
                        <strong>third pillar: exhibition design</strong>, coherence, and how the work should come
                        together moving forward.

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>This week marked a significant milestone as I was shortlisted for GDI after being selected by
                        lecturers to submit a critical essay. Following this, I attended an interview with our school's
                        <strong>Dean, Nur</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>The interview provided an opportunity to articulate my research interests, how my project is
                        going, while reflecting how I can further improve or explore it. I received valuable,
                        insightful, and encouraging feedback from Nur.</p>
