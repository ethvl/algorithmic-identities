                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>This symposium is particularly in contrast to my pillar on <strong>datafication</strong>. While
                        the symposium treats identity as an open-ended, expressive, and self-determined work, my project
                        examines how algorithmic systems <strong>does the opposite</strong> by reducing lived experience
                        into measurable, comparable data points.</p>
                    <p>The contrast strengthens my critical position, where creative practice embraces ambuguity and
                        personal meaning. The data-driven systems prioritise legibility, prediction, and categorisation.
                        This reference can help frame my project as a critique of how contemporary systems overwrite
                        fluid identity with system-defined representations.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Reflection</strong></h3>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>What stood out to me is how identity was approached as something exploratory rather than fixed.
                        Instead of asking participants to define who they are, the experience allowed them to
                        <strong>discover</strong> aspects of themselves through making and reflection. This reinforced
                        my belief that identity is better understood as something that unfolds over time, shaped by
                        interaction and context rather than a single declaration.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was also drawn to how the emphasis was placed on process rather than outcome. Participants were
                        not pressured to arrive at a clear answer, but were instead encouraged to sit with ambiguity.
                        This directly informs how I want audiences to experience my work, not as a system that tells
                        them who they are, but as one that makes them <strong>aware of how systems attempt to define
                            them</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, the symposium highlighted the power of art as a <strong>space for
                            questioning</strong> rather than categorising. In contrast to data-driven systems that
                        reduce identity into measurable data points, I want my work to create moments of reflection
                        where participants can <strong>recognise the gap</strong> between their lived experience and how
                        a system interprets it. This reference helps clarify my intention to design experiences that are
                        <strong>open-ended, unsettling, and reflective</strong>, rather than conclusive or prescriptive.

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>In my dissertation, datafication is defined as the process through which human actions,
                        expressions, and experiences are translated into quantifiable data that can be stored, analysed,
                        and acted upon. This transformation reduces complex, subjective human states into discrete data
                        points, forming what Haggerty and Ericson describe as the data double, a partial and operational
                        version of the self that circulates within computational systems</p>
                    <p>The FROM WORD → NUMBER → LABEL experiment materialises this process at its most fundamental
                        level. Participants begin with natural language, selecting a short statement that reflects an
                        internal state or identity. This input represents the richness and ambiguity of human
                        self-expression. Once submitted, the system immediately converts this statement into a numerical
                        value, followed by a fixed categorical label. This sequence mirrors the logic of datafication:
                        meaning is not preserved, but translated into formats that are legible to machines.</p>

                        physically stages the act of reduction itself, making visible how complex human expression is
                        simplified into data. The numerical output functions as a stand-in for quantifiable signals such
                        as engagement scores, probabilities, or confidence values commonly used in algorithmic systems.
                        The resulting label demonstrates how identity becomes actionable only after it has been
                        simplified into data.

                        so, it foregrounds the first step of algorithmic identity formation: the moment when the self
                        becomes measurable, sortable, and classifiable.</p>

                    <h3><strong>➀ WORLD → NUMBER → LABEL</strong></h3>
                    <p>Andreas pointed out that the framing should shift from WORD to <strong>WORLD</strong>. This
                        correction clarified
                        that the focus is not on language or textual input, but on how elements of the physical world
                        such as actions, behaviours, and lived experiences are captured, quantified, and translated into
                        data. Framing this process as from <strong>WORLD</strong> better reflects how algorithmic
                        systems abstract
                        reality itself, reducing complex, embodied experiences into numerical representations that are
                        later used to categorise and label identity.</p><br>

                    <p><strong>Physical Prototype 1</strong> is currently too overly illustrative and it lacks a
                        meaningful relationship between input and output. The numbers used for the output exist, but
                        they do not mean anything to the user. Users cannot tell why the number appears, they cannot
                        link their action to the system's response, and there is no narrative hook.
                    </p>
                    <p>Andreas referenced this point back to Xander Chin's work, explaining how it wasn't about his
                        visuals, but because there is a causal loop that is immediately legible: <strong>gesture →
                            motion → recognition.</strong> </p>
                    <p>The takeaway is <strong>datafication</strong> must be experienced as a translation, not a
                        randomisation. The core idea is how our human actions are captured as data, reduced into
                        computable form, and used to make decisions about the user. Hence, the prototype must show what
                        is captured, how it is reduced, what is lost, or distorted in the process.</p><br>

                    <p>Up to this point, I finally reached the point in the project where I began to struggle with
                        translating abstract concepts into a physical outcome that makes a clear point. This difficulty
                        surfaced the core challenge of the work: <strong>extracting an argument from theory and
                            expressing it through material form.</strong> Through discussion, we reframed the problem by
                        starting with the exhibition concept, rather than the object itself, using a
                        <strong>before-and-after framework</strong> to examine how interaction might shift participants'
                        perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>By comparing participants' attitudes toward AI before and after encountering with the work, the
                        exhibition becomes a site for observing change, rather than simply displaying artefacts. This
                        approach positions design as an active agent, one that not only visualises issues, but has the
                        potential to shape awareness, provoke reflection, and produce measurable shifts in
                        understanding.</p>

                    <p>As I moved forward with the dissertation, I questioned whether the exhibition proposal should be
                        included within it. Through discussion, Andreas clarified that the discussion section should
                        function as a structured progression, rather than a static reflection. It begines with
                        <strong>Semester 1 experiments</strong>, followed by a reflective transtion from
                        <strong>experimentation to prototyping</strong>, before moving into <strong>Semester 2's
                            prototyping</strong>.

                    <h3>‎ </h3>
                    <p>From there, the discussion should open up to questions of presentation: <em>where and how the
                            work is encountered,</em> leading into exhibition design considerations such as <em>format,
                            influences, and relevant case studies,</em> and ultimately and exhibition proposal. This may
                        be supported by small-scale test setups, such as informal openings, or open studio sessions to
                        gather feedback. Crucially, all sections of the dissertation such as literature review, research
                        objectives, methods, and applications, must remain aligned with this structure, allowing ideas
                        to be consistently linked across the writing.</p>

                        he responded by drawing a small illustration of himself peering into a cave through a tiny hole.
                        The cave, he explained, represented the body of work and research I had accumulated so far. It
                        is dense, expansive, and full of works. While it is reassuring to have "a lot", his point was
                        that from the outside, very little of it was actually visible or legible. I need to be able to
                        make my works legible and understandable to the participants or viewers.</p>

                        form-making and technical execution to refocus on the core idea of datafication itself. Rather
                        than asking what the interface should look like, I returned to the fundamental question of what
                        actually happens when lived experience is translated into measurable data points. This shift
                        allowed me to strip away unnecessary complexity and concentrate on the relationship between
                        input, system interpretation, and output, ensuring that each experiment was grounded in a clear
                        conceptual purpose rather than surface-level interaction.

                    <p>In this experiment, I explored how identity is progressively formed within a system through
                        accumulated keyboard interactions. It focuses on how repeated micro-actions such as key press
                        can contribute incrementally to how a system constructs and recognises a user. with every
                        interaction, the identity becomes increasingly visible, reinforcing the idea that systems do not
                        need complete narratives to define a person, only sufficient behavioural signals.
                    </p>
                    <p>Visually, the identity manifests as a spreading, almost disease-like form across the human
                        silhouette. This was an intentional move to make the growth appear organic, yet unsettling to
                        suggest how datafication operates quietly and persistently, often without the user's awareness.
                        What begins as isolated interactions gradually accumulates into a dominant presence, mirroring
                        how everyday behaviours are continuously captured and compounded into a coherent system
                        identity.</p>
                    <p>By framing the visualisation as something that spreads rather than appears instantly, the
                        experiment critiques how identity under data-driven systems is not chosen, but gradually imposed
                        through participation itself.</p>

                    <p>I began with a fixed human silhouette image, and using image trace, it is composed by ASCII
                        characters. This sets a baseline trace of the subject that never changes. Instead of altering
                        the image itself, I wanted the system to record all user interactions as permanent overlays that
                        accumulate over time.</p>
                    <p>I set the rule where each committed word becomes a data event that is incrementally thickening,
                        enlarging, or distorting clusters of characters within the silhouette. The system only records
                        data when it is submitted using the space or enter button. Rotation is triggered by pressing a
                        single key "E".</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>The interaction is intentionally static and irreversible: nothing changes unless the user acts,
                        and once recorded, actions cannot be undone. Typing becomes a proxy for behavioural data, where
                        longer inputs generate stronger system responses. Randomised placement of effects highlights the
                        opacity of how data is processed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over time, the identity becomes increasingly marked and system-defined. It becomes more
                        recognisable to the human eye. This tensions mirrors how data-driven systems turn our everyday
                        interactions into lasting computational traces.</p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>In the earlier version of this experiment, my main challenge was the system's behaviour which
                        felt too arbitrary and aesthetic-led. The portrat was generated by detecting "white areas" in
                        the image mask, then stamping random ASCII characters onto those regions. While it produced a
                        visually satisfying effect, the logiv became too surface-level. The system wasn't clearly
                        translating the idea of datafication. The stamping was randomised and it was heavily dependent
                        on threshold settings so the outcome was hard to "sell" beyond the visual.</p>
                    <p>I also struggled with control and clarity. Small parameter changes (threshold, strength,
                        character size, spacing) could dramatically alter the image which made the portrait too dark,
                        too sparse, or inconsistent. The interaction also overlapped behaviour.
                        <strong>intensify()</strong> was triggered constantly, which made the system feel like it was
                        always reacting but not necessarily with intention.
                    </p>
                    <p>These challenges pushed me to redesign toward a more deliberate trigger so that accumulation
                        reads as system inscription rather than visual chaos.</p>

                    <p>Building on Andreas’ interpretation of my identity-formation visuals, he read the work as a
                        <strong>commentary</strong> on how we <strong>perceive media content</strong> today, specifically the overwhelming, <strong>continuous influx of information</strong>. He noted how content is consumed <strong>rapidly</strong> and discarded within seconds,
                        and suggested that this could be developed further as a <strong>distorted or fragmented worldview</strong> shaped
                        by fast-paced media consumption. This raised the question of whether my exploration could more
                        explicitly address how social media conditions perception and attention.

                    <h3><strong>➁ Micro-Experiences</strong></h3>
                    <p>A key concern was how these ideas could be communicated through <strong>micro-experiences</strong>. Andreas
                        questioned how <strong>small, momentary interactions</strong> might be used to reflect the speed, repetition, and
                        passivity of scrolling culture, and whether this logic could be <strong>subverted</strong> to deliver more
                        <strong>meaningful or reflective</strong> content instead. The challenge is not only to replicate fast content
                        delivery, but to interrupt it in a way that prompts awareness.

                    <p>I was also questioned on my use of <strong>ASCII</strong> characters, noting that they currently function primarily as an
                        aesthetic choice rather than a conceptually grounded one. To move beyond surface-level visuals,
                        the work needs a <strong>clearer narrative or motivation</strong>, whether through interaction, storytelling, or
                        moving image, so that users understand why they are engaging with the work. Rather than
                        encouraging mindless action, the experience should <strong>provoke self-reflection</strong>, such as questioning
                        habitual behaviours like doom-scrolling.
                    </p><br><br>
                    <h3><strong>➃ Exhibition & Structural Coherence</strong></h3>
                    <p>Given that the project’s outcome is an exhibition contribution, Andreas emphasised the need to
                        think <strong>structurally</strong>: <em>how many works are involved, how they connect, and how they collectively
                        communicate a coherent idea</em>. Instead of a single, monolithic piece, he suggested considering
                        smaller, focused experiments: possibly multiple short interactions where <strong>one clear action
                        produces a visible system response</strong>. These micro-experiments could together visualise how systems
                        shape perception and behaviour, making the underlying structure of media consumption more
                        legible.
