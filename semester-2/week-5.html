                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>Following earlier consultations, it became clear that the uncertainty in my prototypes stemmed
                        from the lack of clarity about the final form of work. Instead of continuing to develop isolated
                        experiments and prototypes, I began envisioning the project as a situated exhibit within a
                        larger exhibition about <strong>algorithms</strong>. This shift reframed my thinking.</p>
                    <p>This week, I designed the exhibition floor plan, and created a 3D model of the space in
                        <strong>Blender</strong>. Modelling the environment allowed me to spatially test how the works
                        might coexist, how audiences would move through them, and how each installation contributes to a
                        cohesive narrative about <strong>algorithmic systems</strong>.

                    <h2><strong>Artist or Curator?</strong></h2>
                    <p>This week's discussion with Andreas fundamentally shifted how I understand my role within the
                        exhibition. The question that surfaced was deceptively simple, yet conceptually loaded.
                        <mark><em><strong>Am I just an artist presenting a singular work, or am I also the curator who
                                    is responsible for shaping and framing the entire exhibition?</strong></em></mark>
                    </p>
                    <p>At first, I had imagined my project as a standable exhibition. Something immersive,
                        self-contained, and conceptually strong enough to exist on its own. However, I realised it would
                        be more impactful if situated within a larger exhibition themed around algorithms. Algorithms do
                        not operate in isolation; they function within systems. Positioning my work within a broader
                        algorithmic context mirrors this logic.</p>
                    <p>As the artist, I develop the installations. I envision multiple installations rather than one
                        singular piece. Each installation isolates a specific pillar such as datafication, feedback
                        loops, while collectively forming a cohesive experience about <strong>Algorithmic
                            Identity</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Designing the floor plan and modelling the 3D space helped me understand how visitors might move
                        through these installations and encounter them sequentially. The exhibition therefore becomes
                        more than a display; it becomes a structured environment where audiences experience how
                        algorithmic systems construct identity.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of data collected to form the <strong>data double</strong>, <strong>biometric
                            data</strong> and <strong>behavioural data</strong>. Biometric data comes from systems like
                        facial recognition, which map measurable features such as the distance between the eyes, the
                        contour of the lips, or the shape of the nose. Behvaioural data, on the other hand, is gathered
                        from the user's digital interactions such as what they click, like, share, upload, or browse.
                        While biometric data captures how the user looks, behavioural data captures how they act.
                        Together, they form the raw material of <strong>Algorithmic Identity</strong>.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>When these two streams of data are combines, they are processed by algorithms to construct an
                        <strong>Algorithmic Identity</strong> which is a profile inferred by AI systems. This identity
                        is not a direct reflection of who the user believes they are, but a calculated persona built
                        from patterns, predictions, and probabilities. It shapes what content the user sees, what ads
                        are targetted at them, and even how platforms categorise them. Through this exhibit, I aim to
                        make this invisible construction visible, helping visitors understand how everyday actions
                        accumulate into a system-generated version of the self.

                        The museum frequently stages immersive, interactive exhibitions that explore digital systems,
                        artificial intelligence, and data-driven environments. These contexts closely aligned with my
                        investigation into <strong>Algorithmic Identities</strong>. Its audience is also diverse,
                        attracting both art-goers, and individuals interested in science and innovation. Situating my
                        work within a space strengthens its relevance, positioning it not just as a design project, but

                    <p>To situate my work within a real context, I search for ArtScience Museum's Basement 2 Floorplan
                        and studied how the larger exhibition might be organised spatially. Rather than designing in
                        isolation, I mapped my exhibit directly onto the exisiting layout. I chose Section 5, placing it
                        before the exit. It is an intentional move as visitors would have already encountered multiple
                        works, allowing my exhibit to function as a moment of reflection and systhesis before departure.
                        It acts as a near-concluding experience, prompting visitors to reconsider what they have seen
                        through the lens of <strong>Algorithmic Identity</strong>.

                    <p>Using existing exhibition floorplans as references, I began planning how I wanted my own exhibit
                        to unfold within the allocated space. Having a real spatial template was extremely helpful, as
                        it allowed me to think carefully about installation placements, circulation paths, etc. I
                        designed the layout to guide visitors through the three sections, biometric data, behavioural
                        data, and Algorithmic Identity as a narrative progression. The spatial arrangement supports this
                        conceptual flow, ensuring that each installation builds upon the previous one, resulting in a
                        coherent and immersive experience, rather than three disconnected works.

                        facial contours and movement. The camera becomes a tool for data translation. It transforms the
                        face into numerical coordinates, and mirrors how biometric systems operate in everyday
                        surveillance environments. It foregrounds how something that is so deeply personal such as our
                        personal features is quietly converted into machine-readable data within algorithmic
                        systems. <em>This prototype is still in refinement, images used are placeholders.</em>

                    <p>Using <strong>Prototype 6: World of Brainrot</strong>, it requires participants to actively
                        "feed" the system through their clicks and interactions. As users navigate and respond, the
                        system records their behavioural data in real time. What feels like casual engagement becomes a
                        process of continuous data production. This installation explores how platforms extract value
                        from attention and repetition, turning simple gestures into measureable metrics. <em>This
                            prototype is still in refinement, images used are placeholders.</em></p><br>

                    <p>The last installation is a LED wall display that merges the biometric and behavioural data
                        collected from the previous installations into a single, woven ouput which is an algorithmically
                        constructed identity. The use of many LED screens on the wall amplifies the presences of this
                        system-generated self, confronting participants with a version of identity assembled from
                        fragments of data. By weaving facial mappings and interation metrics together, the installation
                        visualises how algorithms synthesise diverse inputs into coherent, yet reductive, digital
                        personas. <em>This prototype is still in refinement, images used are placeholders.</em></p>

                <div class="exp-block">
                    <p>Creating the 3D exhibition model in Blender was far more challenging than I anticipated, especially since I was new to 3D modelling using Blender. I spent around 3 days trying to create this entire model. <em>Shoutout to Carissa for teaching me more about Blender, rendering solutions, as well as creating plastic PBR.</em></p>
                    <p>I struggled with basic operations such as selecting and extruding the correct faces, aligning objects accurately to the floorplan, and ensuring surfaces rendered on the intended side. Navigating orientation within a three-dimensional space was particularly frustrating as there were issues with the zoom at times. Distinguishing between global and local axes, camera views, and object origins often disrupted my workflow. Even when the structure was technically complete, the final render felt visually flat and unrefined. The lighting appeared dull, materials lacked depth, and the overall scene did not reflect the clarity I had imagined.</p>
